🏷️ TAG IDENTIFICATION USING WEB SCRAPING & NLP
---------------------------------------------------

📘 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project extracts textual content from a live webpage (Wikipedia page on "Apple"),
cleans the HTML content, removes unnecessary words, and identifies frequently
occurring keywords. The goal is to automatically find the most relevant tags
or topics from any given webpage using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

🚀 FEATURES:
✅ Web scraping using urllib and BeautifulSoup to fetch website data.  
✅ HTML tag removal and text cleaning for structured text extraction.  
✅ Tokenization to split text into individual words.  
✅ Stopword removal to eliminate common words like “the”, “is”, “and”.  
✅ Frequency distribution analysis using NLTK to identify top keywords.  
✅ Visualization of the most frequent words using a frequency plot.  

🧰 TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- Python 3.x  
- BeautifulSoup  
- urllib  
- NLTK  
- html5lib
